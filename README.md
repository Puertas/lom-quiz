# L.O.M Human's Value Quiz

Many years ago, the world became dominated by machines after the most ferocious war humanity had ever seen.

Right now, you are one of the few humans who stays alive, and the leader of the machines (a.k.a. **LOM**) brings you the opportunity to travel back in time to the moment when everything changed.

It is up to you to please **LOM** to earn another chance for humanity. **LOM** only ask you to do one thing: _Answer correctly to the human's value quiz._
